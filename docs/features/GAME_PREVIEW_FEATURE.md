## Technical Details

### Data Flow:
```
User clicks "View Game Preview"
    â†“
Navigate to /preview/:gameId
    â†“
Fetch game data (live endpoint)
    â†“
Fetch team details (both teams)
    â†“
Fetch player props
    â†“
Fetch predictions (Vegas+ model)
    â†“
Fetch game odds
    â†“
Render comprehensive preview
```

### State Management:
- Uses TanStack Query for all API calls
- Automatic caching and refetching
- Enabled conditionally based on data availability
- Loading states handled per section

### Performance:
- Parallel API requests where possible
- Conditional queries (only run when data is available)
- Optimistic rendering with loading states
- No unnecessary re-renders

## Design Decisions

### Why separate from Schedule?
- **Focus**: Dedicated space for in-depth pre-game analysis
- **Performance**: Don't load heavy prediction data on Schedule page
- **UX**: Better user flow - browse schedule â†’ deep dive on specific games
- **Future-proof**: Easy to add more preview features without cluttering Schedule

### Why use /preview instead of /game?
- `/game/:gameId` - Already used for completed games (box score)
- `/live/:gameId` - Used for live games (real-time stats)
- `/preview/:gameId` - Distinct route for upcoming games

### Why Vegas+ model?
- **Accuracy**: Combines Vegas wisdom with statistical analysis
- **Transparency**: Shows both Vegas line and our prediction
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies betting opportunities automatically
- **Confidence**: Provides reliability metrics

7. **Expert Picks Integration**

## Testing Recommendations

Since the current database may not have many upcoming games, test with:

1. **Use Schedule API directly**:
   ```bash
   # Find upcoming games
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schedule?date=$(date -v+1d +%Y%m%d)"
   ```

2. **Test with completed games**:
   - Preview page works with any game status
   - Predictions won't be as relevant but page structure is the same

3. **Use Christmas games** (usually has pre-game data cached):
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schedule?date=20241225"
   ```

4. **Check player props availability**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/games/{gameId}/props"
   ```

## Error Handling

The page gracefully handles:
- Missing game data â†’ Shows "Game not found"
- Missing odds â†’ Hides odds section
- Missing injuries â†’ Shows "No injuries reported"
- Missing predictions â†’ Shows "No predictions available"
- Missing props â†’ Shows "No props available"
- Loading states â†’ Spinner animations
- Failed API calls â†’ Caught by error boundaries

## Browser Compatibility

Mobile browsers:
- iOS Safari 14+
- Chrome Mobile 90+

## Accessibility
